Hello there,

It's great to see you here! I wanted to share with you that writing tests for repositories is a good idea to ensure that the infrastructure is working properly. These types of tests are categorized as integration tests because they test the integrity of the application code with the database system.

However, in-memory repositories are frequently used in unit tests, so it may not be necessary to write tests for them. That being said, if we encounter conditions that require us to write tests for in-memory repositories, we can write them here.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
